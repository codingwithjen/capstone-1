# Springboard's Capstone-1 Project
### Weather App API

Versions I am currently using and instructions are based off of this<br>

Python --version *3.9.6*<br> - you will need Python installed on a local environment<br>
macOS Monterey *Version 12.0.1*<br>
PostgreSQL *v13*<br>
Check the *requirements.txt* file to see the different packages installed and their versions <br>


First, Git Clone the Repo in Command Line (Instructions for Mac Users):
1. COMMAND + SPACE BAR and type in search "terminal"
2. In the Terminal window, choose the location you want the directory located in
3. cd to your desired location, and *git clone https://github.com/codingwithjen/capstone-1.git*
4. Create a venv file: `python3 -m venv venv`
5. Activate the virtual environment before installing any libraries via pip `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Once activated, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Sign up via OpenWeather for an API key - I have hidden this in my *.gitignore* file and via *dotenv*
8. Once all the packages are installed, `export FLASK_ENV=development` and then ENTER
9. Once you hit ENTER, type in `flask run`
10. Use your local server URL on a browser (I use Chrome)
11. To end the live server, on the Terminal window, enter CONTROL + C
12.
